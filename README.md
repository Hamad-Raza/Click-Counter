Each time the button is clicked, the number inside the `<p>` tag increases by 1.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – for structure (button + paragraph).
- **CSS** – for basic styling of the button and layout.
- **JavaScript** – for handling the click event and updating the counter.

## How It Works
1. The number starts at 0 inside the `<p>` tag.
2. A JavaScript function `incClick()` reads the number using `textContent`.
3. It increments the number and updates the paragraph with the new value.
4. The function is triggered using an `addEventListener` on the button.
